# Impromptster
This is the repository for Impromptster (Impromptu + Imposter), a light hearted team building game in Angular.

There is a spinning wheel with the names of participants. Once the wheel stops spinning, the pointer points to a randomly selected
name of a participant. Let's call that participant as Player 1. Now, to make the game interesting, the host of the game chooses the
participant who's name is exactly opposite Player 1 in the wheel. Let's call the selected participant as Player 2.

Now, Player 2 will be presented some question which he/she will answer as Player 1.
